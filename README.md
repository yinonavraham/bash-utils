# bash-utils
Bash script utilities for general use

## Setup
The scripts rely on an environment variable which defines the directory where the scripts are located.
In order for the scripts to be able to resolve other scripts, make sure to setup the following variable:  
`BASH_UTILS_HOME=/path/to/root/of/this/project`  
(i.e. to where the `lib` & `utils` directory and the `README.md` file are located)
